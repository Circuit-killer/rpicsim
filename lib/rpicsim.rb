# TODO: unify the way that code space, RAM, and EEPROM variables can be defined and accessed

# TODO: add a feature for calculating the minimum and maximum iteration
#   time from one point in the program to another
#   (as a special case, this lets you calculate the iteration time of the
#     main loop if both points are the same)
