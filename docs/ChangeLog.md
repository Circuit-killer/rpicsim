0.4.0
----
NOT RELEASED YET

- Adds {RPicSim::Memory#read_bytes} and {RPicSim::Memory#write_bytes}.
- Adds {RPicSim::Sim#stack_memory}.
- Fixes a bug in the RSpec 3.x suppoort that was causing the informative error messages when an example fails to not work.
- Adds the ability to get load symbols into your simulation from a source besides the program file.
    - Adds {RPicSim::Sim::ClassDefinitionMethods#use_symbols}
    - Adds {RPicSim::Sim::ClassDefinitionMethods#def_symbol}
    - Adds {RPicSim::Sim::ClassMethods#symbols}
    - Adds {RPicSim::Sim::ClassMethods#symbols_in_ram}
    - Adds {RPicSim::Sim::ClassMethods#symbols_in_program_memory}
    - Adds {RPicSim::Sim::ClassMethods#symbols_in_eeprom}
- Adds the {RPicSim::Xc8SymFile} class, which can load symbols from a SYM file produced by the XC8 compiler and then be passed to {RPicSim::Sim::ClassDefinitionMethods#use_symbols use_symbols}.  This was necessary because the COF files produced by XC8 are difficult to interpret and do not always allow us to tell what memory space a given symbol is for.

0.3.0
----
Released on 2014-06-20.

- Adds support for RSpec 3.x.  This release was tested with RSpec 2.14.1, 2.99.0, and 3.0.0.
- Adds support for MPLAB X 2.10.

0.2.5
----
Released on 2014-05-02.

- {RPicSim::Sim#stack_push} and {RPicSim::Sim#return} now update the TOSU, TOSH, and TOSL registers if they exist.
  This fixes bugs that were happening when using those methods in PIC18 simulations.
- Added recognition for more types of symbols found in XC8-generated COF files, but there are still issues with proper identification of variables in programs compiled with XC8.

0.2.4
----
Released on 2014-03-17.

- Added code for recognizing more types of symbols from XC8.  The XC8 symbols are more complicated than I previously thought.

0.2.3
----
Released on 2014-03-17.

- Fixed a bug preventing symbols in RAM generated by the XC8 compiler from being recognized.

0.2.2
----
Released on 2014-03-07.

- Fixed a bug in {RPicSim::Sim#new_ram_watcher} that prevented it from working.

0.2.1
----

Released on 2014-03-07.

- This release includes many, many breaking changes.

0.1.0
----

Released on 2014-02-12.
This is the initial release.
There are still some major things missing from this version that need to be added before we release 1.0.0.
Until 1.0.0 is released, we will not worry about backwards compatibility or writing complete change logs.
