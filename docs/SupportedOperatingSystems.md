# Supported Operating Systems

RPicSim currently only supports Windows.  However, it should be easy to get it working on Linux or Mac OS X: probably the only code that would need to be changed is the code in `mplab_x.rb` that helps find the MPLAB X directory automatically and the code that detects what version of MPLAB X is being used.
