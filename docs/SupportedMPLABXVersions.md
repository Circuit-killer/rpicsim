# Supported MPLAB X versions

RPicSim uses code in MPLAB X to actually perform the PIC simulation.  Therefore, changes to MPLAB X might affect RPicSim and require changes.  Currently, RPicSim supports the following versions of MPLAB X:

- 1.85
- 1.90
- 1.95
- 2.00
- 2.05
- 2.10

The different versions of MPLAB X have different problems that affect the simulation.  For more information, see the {file:KnownIssues.md Known issues page}.

If you would like to power RPicSim with one version of MPLAB X and use another as your actual IDE, see {file:HowMPLABXIsFound.md How MPLAB X is found}.
