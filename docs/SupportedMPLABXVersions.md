# Supported MPLAB X versions

RPicSim uses code in MPLAB X to actually perform the PIC simulation.  Therefore, changes to MPLAB X might affect RPicSim and require changes.  Currently, RPicSim supports the following versions of MPLAB X:

- 1.85
- 1.90
- 1.95

The different versions of MPLAB X have different flaws.  For more information, see {file:Flaws.md Flaws}.

If you would like to power RPicSim with one version of MPLAB X and use another as your actual IDE, see {file:HowMPLABXIsFound.md How MPLAB X is found}.
