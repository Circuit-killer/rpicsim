# Supported devices

RPicSim aims to support all 8-bit PIC microcontrollers.  No support is planned for 16-bit or 32-bit PIC microcontrollers because we do not have an interest in using those devices.

RPicSim relies on MPLAB X code to perform the actual simulation, and MPLAB X abstracts away most of the differences between different PIC microcontrollers.
